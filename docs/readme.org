* NixOS and Home-Manager Configuration

"Doing anything in Nix causes me untold pain and suffering, and wastes absurd
amounts of my time ... unless it follows a path already well-trodden by me
personally. I put myself through this because I know that, after all the pain,
suffering and wasted time, if eventually I reach my destination, I will have a
robust, reliable, reusable solution which will save me even more pain, suffering
and time in the long run." Jacek Generowicz

** Usage
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: usage
   :END:

1. Clone this repo

2. Enter the dev environment

   #+begin_example
     $ nix develop
   #+end_example

3. Build OS

   #+begin_example
     $ just build
   #+end_example

3. Update upstream inputs

   #+begin_example
     $ just update
   #+end_example

4. Format, lint, size, clean, search, run and more:

   #+begin_example
     $ just
   #+end_example

** Goals
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: goals
   :END:

1.  Open source by default (public code, auditable, community focused)

    - currently: nix+git+github(this repo)

2.  Minimal attack surface (less apps, simpler apps, minimal customization)

    - currently: i3+kitty+restic+kak

3.  Reproducible setup (pinned versions, one step build)

    - currently: flakes
    - nix pinning: difficult to maintain
    - channels: impure

4.  Safe defaults (rm -i, vpn, encrypted disk and swap, autolock, frecuent and
    automatic dedup write-only backup)

    - current backup: restic (dedup backup with snapshots on time),
    - current sync: rclone (accesible via backblaze mobile app)
    - current storage: backblaze (not write-only), will be solved with wasabi
    - current vpn: mullvad (multihop + socks5 + killswitch), proton too slow
    - current browser: chromium+plugins, brave not working with plugins

5.  Secrets on remote vault

    - currently: 1password CLI with enviroment substitution
    - sops: never store the secrets
    - gitcrypt: not encrypted at rest in clonned repo
    - pass: several files and complex git workflow
    - pass+tomb: more tools and same results with sops

6.  Declarative and avoid of imperative configuration

    - currently: home over tmpfs
    - future: pending root (/) over blank zfs/brtfs
    - future: install as code 

7.  Functional programming

    - currently: NixEL+Nixpkgs+NixOS+Home-Manager

8.  Easy to use (sexy security)

    - currently: only grub password, then autologin (only one user) 

9.  Separation of concerns (one functionality needs multiple touch points)

    - currently: using modules for os configuration
    - pending: apply same strategy for home-manager
    - past: everything in one file

10. Keyboard centric
