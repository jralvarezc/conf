* NixOS and Home-Manager Configuration

"Doing anything in Nix causes me untold pain and suffering, and wastes absurd
amounts of my time ... unless it follows a path already well-trodden by me
personally. I put myself through this because I know that, after all the pain,
suffering and wasted time, if eventually I reach my destination, I will have a
robust, reliable, reusable solution which will save me even more pain, suffering
and time in the long run." Jacek Generowicz

** Usage
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: usage
   :END:

1. Clone this repo

2. Update, rebuild, switch and clean

#+begin_example
  $ ./update.sh
#+end_example

3. Search for software:

#+begin_example
  $ nix search nixpkgs '\.mutt$'
#+end_example

4. Test new software without installing it:

#+begin_example
  $ nix run nixpkgs#mutt
#+end_example

** Goals
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: goals
   :END:

1.  Open source by default (public code, auditable, community focused)

    - currently: nix+git+github(this repo)

2.  Minimal attack surface (less apps, simpler apps, minimal customization)

    - currently: i3+kitty+restic (800 LOC)

    #+begin_example
      $ nix run nixpkgs#tokei .

3.  Reproducible setup (pinned versions, one step build)

    - currently: flakes
    - nix pinning: difficult to maintain
    - channels: impure

4.  Safe defaults (rm -i, vpn, encrypted disk and swap, autolock, frecuent and
    automatic dedup write-only backup)

    - current backup: restic (dedup), tresorit (filesync with mobile)
    - current storage: backblaze (not write-only), will be solved with wasabi
    - current vpn: mullvad (multihop + socks5 + killswitch), proton too slow
    - current browser: chromium+plugins, brave not working with plugins

5.  Secrets as code (versioned, encrypted at rest)

    - currently: gnupg+sops+yaml_keys
    - gitcrypt: not encrypted at rest in clonned repo
    - pass: several files and complex git workflow
    - pass+tomb: more tools and same results with sops

6.  Declarative and avoid of imperative configuration

    - currently: some nix-env installations are used -TODO-
    - future: always destroyed nix-env generations

7.  Functional programming

    - currently: NixEL+Nixpkgs+NixOS+Home-Manager

8.  Easy to use (sexy security)

    - currently: grub password but not at login, long timeouts for gpg-agent

9.  Separation of concerns (one functionality needs multiple touch points)

    - currently: using modules for os configuration
    - pending: apply same stratety for home-manager
    - past: everything in one file

10. Keyboard centric

** Contradictions
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: contradictions
   :END:

1. Emacs vs Vi regarding requirement of minimal attack surface (less apps,
   simpler apps)

2. Monorepo for conf and blog will be a simpler configuration
